# Blarnus App
* * *
##Agenda
1. Look at the design
2. Do the html
3. Do the Sass
4. All done

## Look at the design
[Link to the design](http://stewsmith.co/blarnus_app.pdf)
####What are we looking for?
1. Things in common (spacing, colors, fonts)
2. Items on a grid
3. Stuff that looks scary that you don't know how to do.

##HTML
Chunks of stuff are divs  
Use section tag and other html5 tags  
HTML is chill and not too crazy

##Sass
* Sass vs Css?  
* variables  
* mixins

##Flexbox
What is flexbox?  

* A smarter way of displaying items.
* Can replace grids
* Can use for unknown number of items
* Not supported by < IE 10

##Advice
1. Web Programming is not school programming so don't get discouraged when you suck
2. Gotta do it yourself, not just read about it (You can't get good at golf by reading about it)
3. Excercise everyday for your body and mind
4. Floss everyday
